To try the program edit the INPUT_VIDEO and OUTPUT_PATH in main.py, or use the default values.

We recommend using videos with 320x180 resolution since that is what the program was designed to work with.

The INPUT_VIDEO will be analysed for abnormal events and bounding boxed will be drawin over events, an image sequence is saved in OUTPUT_PATH.

Finally run "python main.py" to execute the program.
